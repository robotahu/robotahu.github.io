This is the first character for my game project.

There he is! Rengkuh Raujang. What a cool name, right?

It’s really hard to find a good name that sounds ‘sundanese’. I pick a sundanese name, because this game.. it is all about my city,  Sumedang. I create ‘this game’ (i haven’t named it yet) to promoting my city to my country.. even to the world (hopefully). So tourists (local and foreigner) would know there’s this beautiful little city resides in West Java. I don’t know, i think promoting something with games is a brand new way , am i right?

So, what do you think? sounds different in your ears? This RENGKUH RAUJANG?

Oh.. i’ll continually post the progressions of this game..
