This is my first self-made game, “The Battle of Preman Pasar”.

I made this with Adobe Flash and some Action Script 2.0. It’s a multiplayer fighting game. I made this for my class project back in the fifth semester. Actually, this game isn’t finished yet. No sounds, bad graphics, very limited movements, and lot of features that unavailable like other fighting games in common. Sorry, Newbie..

This game 'talks' about 2 social hooligans punch and kick each others in a nowhere area. The characters are Hasim Maung and Udin Getih.

I hope i could continue to develop this game. HOPEFULLY..
