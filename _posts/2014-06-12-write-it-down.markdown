So, I just read an article about 17 things extraordinary people do everyday. And one of the points in the article said: ” Write down what happened”. Hmm.. looks fun. Okay then, Let’s do that! Wait, let’s do something different, rather than ‘write down what happened’, what if I ‘write down what will happen’ instead. Let me see if it will work and motivates myself to keep my time effectively used. Because, you know.. I am such a professional procrastinator, seriously.

So, what would i do today?

Learn Ruby on Rails.

This is the most important thing-to-do for today. Because, I want to master this framework for applying for my dream job as a Software Developer.

And, I’ll write what happened today also, and let’s see how this plan going. And maybe i’ll write it in a haiku form like the article said. 🙂 insyaAllah.

That’s it! Let’s Roll!
