Oi there!

Here we are! This is the level selection. These sprites.. the player will pick the levels in the game. There are 5 level and each level has 3-5 sub-level (hope so).. ðŸ˜€

FYI, 4 of these levels is the real tourist sites from Sumedang. But, one of them (Tahu Factory) was made. This Tahu Factory is just a representation of the well known Sumedangâ€™s tofus. You know, there are a lot of tahu (tofu) maker, here in Sumedang.

So, each level has a unique game form one from another depend on what we could find from the real sites itselves. For example, The Alun-alun Sumedang level, the real site is the place where we (sumedang people) gather every sunday. Usually, some people jogging at the jogging track, then there will be a jogging thingy in this levelâ€™s sub -level. Yeah, something like that..

And for other levels. I havenâ€™t decide it yet. So, iâ€™d really appreciate if you share your idea too. Puch me at twitter @simudin or Face book then.

Thatâ€™s it for today.
